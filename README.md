Thank you all who have participated in this project <br>
who motivated me to move forward and participated <br>
in project development in over all.

Entire project is built using Jekyll. In my working <br>
environment I also used Gulp to significantly increase <br>
my performance flow. Regarding the code I was using <br>
Jade and SASS preprocessors that reduces the code size <br>
and visually provides better structure. Bourbon was used <br>
to minimize SASS, Skeleton was a framework that helped to <br>
start this project. Regarding the responsiveness, everything <br>
was build from complete 0, some errors might occur, however <br>
they will be sorted out over time. 

A huge thanks also goes to Travis, Devtips, who thought <br>
many useful things that will help me on my future career.
